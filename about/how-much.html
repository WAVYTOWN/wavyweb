    <h1 class="heading-text-main case-study underline">how much? <br>(how to stretch your budget)</h1>
    <div class="spacer smaller"></div>
    <p class="body-text _50"><strong>This is often the first question asked. To answer it, we meet with you to run through a scoping document where your specific requirements are discussed and how best to proceed from there. We ask many carefully chosen questions to efficiently build a picture of the business and the desired outcome as well as what the budget or cashflow requirements are. Either you will write a brief using our Brief Templates or we can generate the brief which later becomes the proposal.<br><br>Clients who believe that an integrated marketing approach will benefit their business often approach us in order that we help them stretch their budget and get as much leverage as possible. We&#x27;re flexible in our remuneration. We feel that the best way to stretch your budget is to understand what the initial budget is. Then to get as much value as possible, using economies of scale where possible, ensuring that all the key areas of your business plan are addressed. Then, when we know that all the intended bases are covered, we can adjust the allocation of budgets to put money into areas of most importance that can best drive results.</strong></p>

    <h1 class="heading-text-main case-study underline">sounds expensive, but maybe not.</h1>
    <div class="spacer smaller"></div>
    <p class="body-text _50"><strong>1. You can pick a service you require and pay as you go at hourly rates.</strong> <br>And also receive up to 35% discounts on print and external suppliers.<br><br><strong>2. Choose a kick-starter package. </strong><br>And also receive up to 35% discounts on print and external suppliers. If there is work we need to do over and above what was initially discussed – or there are changes to the original brief, we will re-cost the job before starting on the new work. <br><br><strong>3. Cost Estimate upfront based on an estimated number of hours per job. </strong><br>And also receive up to 35% discounts on print and external suppliers. If there is work we need to do over and above what was initially discussed – or there are changes to the original brief, we will re-cost the job before starting on the new work.<br><br><strong>4. Annual retainer fee with added value (10% reduction on creative fee). </strong><br>And also receive up to 35% discounts on print and external suppliers. We will quote an estimated volume of work for a one year period or offer a certain fixed number of days per week/month. Thereafter averaged out and billed monthly. If however ad hoc work is added, the retainer will need to be reviewed. The retainer will be for creative and concept work only and will not include production costs. Most clients believe that by getting agencies to quote on the job they will get a better price. This is never the case, though few clients believe this. The best way to stretch your budget is to understand what the budget is upfront. If you opt for an upfront cost estimate or retainer, we will endeavour to do all the work within a pre-arranged cost estimate or monthly retainer. If there is work we need to do over and above what was initially discussed – or there are changes to the original brief, we will re-cost the job before starting on the new work.<br><br><strong>5. We invest in you.<br></strong>On some occasions we are open to negotiating a risk reversal option whereby Dinergy is only paid on the results that a campaign achieves. We understand that budgets are often tight. In light of this, we offer a remuneration package that suits us both. We assess the project, evaluate the time and risk to initiate the campaign, and if it meets our criteria, we invest in you for no upfront fee. We take a long term view and agree to be paid 5% on gross income, paid monthly. This means it costs you nothing until the project starts making money or you secure funding - freeing up cash-flow and more importantly allowing you and Dinergy to be more pro-active. Another benefit is that we can produce any required collateral to secure funding without the usual up-front costs. This option gives you the best opportunity to trial different adverts, headlines, creative, etc, as it is in both our interests to get a return on the advert. This could become expensive if quoted on an hourly basis. It takes all the upfront risk out of any marketing strategy. <br><strong>It’s a potentially risky strategy for us, but if we believe in you and help you succeed, it’s a win win situation.</strong><br>When dinergy is contracted as an ongoing partner, all of the services mentioned below are included with the exception of hard costs from external suppliers. Because our fees will be proportionate to your turnover, dinergy is not restrained by budget and can immediately launch the product as strongly as possible, using all our marketing, muscle as early as possible. There will be no holding back - we are all-in and as committed as you are. But, due to the massive up-front investment in time, we select potential partners very carefully. <br><br><strong>6. Dinergy&#x27;s network muscle continually saves you money. </strong><br>As well as award winning creative, we will save you money by sharing our suppliers to reduce hard costs through an extensive network gathered from international trade shows and many years of experience. Part of this network includes Australian, Chinese, Taiwanese and South African suppliers. This supply chain has great value due to the favourable exchange rate as well as the trust gained by working with them on projects over the years. These costs will be supplied with no mark-up as a part of the partnership agreement #5. </p>
